- We got sampling error if we subtract the sample mean from population mean
- Sampling distribution is a model to estimate the difference between sample mean and population mean
- Sampling is usually enough to estimate population when population is too big to be conducted on a research
- Simple random sampling requires sampled population charateristics are the same with target population and they are selected randomly
- We must choose sample in the same time frame
