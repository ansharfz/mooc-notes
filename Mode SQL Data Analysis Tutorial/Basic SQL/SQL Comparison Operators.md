- We can use comparison operators like <, >, !, <>, to compare numerical and non-numerical data.
- There is a different ordering for alphabets . For example. if we query month > "J" then words with extra alphabet (Ja, Jan, Janu) are treated as greater than J.
- Arithmetic can be performed on columns. Columns that are being performed arithmetic is called '*derived column*'
- Actual numbers can be used in operators with columns.
